This is an incomplete fake implementation of [ModuleDriver] to be used for mod
tests. Not all methods are implemented, and the existing method implementations
are still incomplete.

Currently put, get, and watch are implemented and startModule is partly
implemented.

Please complete the implementation as needed, but for each new behavior added,
please add a new test to test/fake_module_driver_test.dart.

To run tests, make sure you've fx set correctly and then run:
  `fx run-host-tests fake_module_driver_test`
