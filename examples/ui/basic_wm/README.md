# Basic Flutter-based Window Manager Example

This directory contains a simple window manager written in Flutter using
the ChildView widget.

Click on the buttons to create new application windows which can be dragged
around or closed.

The bottom right grab handle (green) resizes the content view, giving it
a larger number of logical pixels to draw in.

The bottom left grab handle (yellow) scales the content view, making each
of its logical pixels bigger or smaller.

## USAGE
