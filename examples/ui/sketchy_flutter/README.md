# Sketchy/Flutter example

This example shows how to use the Sketchy service directly from Flutter, and
demonstrates how a third-party service might enable a Flutter app to generate
graphical effects that could not be achieved with pure Dart code talking to the
Flutter engine.

TODO: this currently only demonstrates a partial wrapping of the Scenic API;
integration with Sketchy is not yet started.

TODO: proper disposal of Scenic resources.
