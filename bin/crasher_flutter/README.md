Utility program to simulate a Flutter app throwing an unhandled Flutter error or
Dart exception, resulting in a Dart crash caught by the C++ Flutter VM runner.
The program can be run as follows:

```sh
$ sessionctl add_mod fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/crasher_flutter#meta/crasher_flutter.cmx
```

Then the developer can click on any of the available buttons to simulate the
desired behavior.
