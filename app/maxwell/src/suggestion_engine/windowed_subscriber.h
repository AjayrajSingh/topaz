// This class is a side-effect of implementing something that's logically
// pull-based (the Ask workflow) on top of a push-based system. Once Asks
// are entirely pull-based, a windowed subscriber will not be necessary.
//
// WindowedSuggestionSubscribers provide a fixed-size window on top of a
// read-only list of ranked suggestions (RankedSuggestions) -- this view
// contains the top N results, where N can be defined through SetResultCount.
//
// When N is updated, the WindowedSuggestionSubscriber checks to see if its
// window needs to be resized. Let's assume it must be resized, and the
// difference between the current size and the desired size is D:
// 1) If the window is to be shrunk, all listeners are notified with OnRemove
//    events for the D suggestions that are currently in the window,
//    but will not be in the window after resizing.
//
// 2) If the window is to be expanded, and the underlying read-only list is
//    larger than the current window size, then OnAdd events are dispatched
//    to all listeners for every suggestion that is included in the new window.
