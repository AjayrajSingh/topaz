// This class is currently responsible for 3 things:
//
// 1) Maintaining repositories of ranked Suggestions (stored inside
//    the RankedSuggestions class) for both Ask and Next proposals.
//  a) Ask suggestions are issued by AskHandlers, in a pull-based model
//     in response to Ask queries. Ask queries are issued via the
//     DispatchAsk method, and Suggestions are asynchronously returned
//     through DispatchAsk's callback.
//
//     The set of Ask proposals for the latest query are currently
//     buffered in the ask_suggestions_ member, though this process can
//     be made entirely stateless.
//
//  b) Next suggestions are issued by ProposalPublishers through the
//     Propose method, and can be issued at any time. These proposals
//     are stored in the next_suggestions_ member.
//
//   Whenever a RankedSuggestions object is updated, that update is pushed
//   to its registered subscribers (SuggestionSubscribers). These subscribers
//   are registered on a SuggestionChannel object -- each RankedSuggestions
//   object has a single SuggestionChannel.
//
// 2) Storing FIDL bindings for AskHandlers and ProposalPublishers.
//
//  a) ProposalPublishers (for Next Suggestions) can be registered via the
//     RegisterPublisher method.
//
//  b) AskHandlers are currently registered through
//     ProposalPublisher.RegisterAskHandler, but this is unnecessary coupling
//     between the ProposalPublisher (a Next interface) and AskHandler (an Ask
//     interface), so this should eventually be changed with the addition of
//     SuggestionEngine.RegisterAskHandler
//
// 3) Acts as a SuggestionProvider for those wishing to subscribe to
//    Suggestions.

  // Asks are currently logically pull-based, but implemented on top of a

  // AskSubscriber has two responsibilities:
  //  1) Take the queries passed to the `controller` (via SetUserQuery) and hand
  //     those off to the SuggestionEngineImpl's (or whichever class implements
  //     AskDispatcher) DispatchAsk method. DispatchAsk will fan the query out
  //     to all registered AskHandlers and the results are pushed into
  //     ask_suggestions_.
  //
  //  2) Since ask_suggestions_ is a RankedSuggestions, it has a
  //     SuggestionChannel with registered SuggestionSubscribers. The
  //     AskSubscriber is a SuggestionSubscriber, and so also functions as a
  //     proxy to pass the latest query results back to `listener`.

  // ask_suggestions_
